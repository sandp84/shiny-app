#### Why use carbohydrate calculations to replace insulin?

**Carbohydrates** break down into glucse once digested. People with diabetes have trouble with high blood sugar after eating carbohydrates because the body does not make enough insulin or the cells in the body are resistant to insulun, or both.[1] Carbohydrate counting is the best method to calculate mealtime insulin doses[2]

#### Calculating insulin replacement based on carbohydrate intake
Insulin replacement based on carbohydrate intake can be obtained by calculating your correction dose and your meal bolus based on your carbohydrate intake. Your healthcare provider needs provided you some guideline for your pre-meal blood sugar goal, your insulin sensitivity factor, and your insulin-to-carb ratio.

The formula for calculating insulin doses based on carbohydrate intake includes your correction dose and your carbohydrate dose.

>Insulin dose=correction dose + carbohydrate dose

###Calculating your Correction Dose
To calculate your correction dose, check your premeal blood sugar and subtract your pre-meal blood sugar goal. You will also need to know your insulin sensistivity factor. This formula will obtain your correction dose.

>Correction dose = (PMBS - PMBSG)/ISF

where *PMBS* represents your pre-meal blood sugar, *PMBSG* represents your pre-meal blood sugar goal, and *ISF* represents your insulin sensitivity factor. 

###Calculating your Carbohydrate Dose

To calculate your carbobydrate dose, count the carbohydrates in your meal and divide the total carbohydrates in your meal by your insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio.

>Carbohydrate dose = TMC/ICR

where *TMC* represents your total meal carbohydrates, *ICR* represents your insulin-carbohydrate-ratio.

**Remember** that your pre-meal blood sugar goal, insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio, and your insulin sensitivity factor come from your healthcare provider's recommendations.
